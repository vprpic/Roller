# Talent Camp - Expertise Test

Roller is a mobile game with the goal of relaxing players and getting them in the zone. The player moves along two lanes and avoids random obstacles, such as trees and rocks, while collecting points.
I started the game with the basic layout of the playfield. Next I added spawn points for the obstacles and created obstacle prefabs which spawn at a regular interval at a random spawn point. Then I turned to the player controls and I added tap controls from a project I worked on recently. Collectables were next, I made them spawn in the same way obstacles spawn choosing a random free spawn position. After that I added the player character, it's movement and a UI score preview. I added 3d models for the obstacles and edited the look of the game.

The main challenge in making this game was the time constraint. A week is enough time, but I had other deadlines for college which reduced the time I had for making this game. I also had some issues with making the feel of the game, but after some playthroughs and thoughts from family members I decided on the current version.

If I had a bit more time I would have made the starting screen, changed the collectables and changed the player into an animated woodland animal like a fox. There are more things I could have included but all in all I am satisfied with the outcome.
